Probabilistic Deep Sequence Models for Bayesian Optimization (A11)
Mentors: Rose Yu, Yian Ma

1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
    * The most interesting topic covered in the domain this quarter was learning about how deep active bayesian learning worked for this spatio-temporal model.
      It was cool to see a unique architecture with a very smart way to select the next best set of parameters.
      I thought that this really expanded my view of what machine learning architectures could look like and could inspire my future endevors.
2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
    * I want to investigate how the API can be used to create compute instances and how to estimate the cost of those instances before running them.
      I think this will really make the API much more scalable and allow the people who manage it to have a good idea of costs before hand.
3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
    * A potential change I would want to make is to have a more organized group next quarter. I want to have a group that meets at consistent times so we can get more work done in a timely manner.
4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
    * A technique I would be interested in is learning about different services on cloud providers like google cloud or aws.
      For this project in particular, I think this would help a lot in making choices later on.
